# OR-Project

# Introduction
This project's main objective is to create an optimized model for the School of Mathematics' timetabling system, addressing current timetable clashes. We consider identifying and resolving conflicts among compulsory courses in the year level 8. But for the level 10 and 11, we consider them together due to the 3rd year, 4th year and 5th year students have a lot of flexibility to choose each other's course. 

The model will generate specific recommendations, including the number of additional classrooms required to have a clash-free timetable. Our project aims to deliver this main outcome: the strategic addition of classrooms to reduce scheduling conflicts. By implementing these recommendations, the School of Mathematics may improve its timetabling efficiency and academic delivery, which will benefit both faculty and students.

# File included
We uploaded the data we uses which is 'Filter.xlsx'. The 'OR Code.ipynb' file provided the code that we wrote. 

# Results
The updated timetable named 'Final Timetable.xlsx'
